    "Answer: My data was UCLA provided hypothetical student admissions by GPA, GRE, and university prestige (1-4 with 4 being least prestigious). First I assessed that there weren't any missing data entries. Theree weren't any noteable outliers in the three independent variables using IQR +/- 1.5 times the standard deviation. GRE scores were between 0 and 800, the value range of the test. And GPAs fell between their logic range of 0 and 4. \n",

Then I dummified the categorical variable prestige, getting rid of my baseline, prestige = 1, to avoid multicollinearity. From there, I used a logistic regression to determine that all three variables are statistically significant, with university prestige having an inverse relationship to graduate school admittance. Alma mater prestige was the most significant, going from attending a prestige = 1 to prestige = 2 undergrad program changes the log odds by -.675."
